# Dungeon-Escape

Welcome to Dungeon's Grip (original working title was Dungeon Escape, which is the reason its the project name). Your goal is to find the key to the dungeon door and escape. Along the way there will be monsters trying to stop you from escaping. Magic potions will be scattered around the dungeon, although all potions might not help you...

KNOWN BUGS

Key - at some points the key wont open the door even when collected. The cause of this issue is unknown but the main explanation is because an older version of Monogame engine is being used. To fix this issue, simply replay the game and the key will work.

Animations - Sometimes the animations wont work correctly on the player. This issue will be patched during the next update, as there is a limited amount of time in the project.
